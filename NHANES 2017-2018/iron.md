Component Description
Specific goals of the serum iron status component include providing data in a nationally representative sample to: 
1) assess overall iron status and function; 
2) assess iron deficiency anemia and anemias of chronic diseases; 
3) monitor trends in measures of nutritional status; and 
4) assess and provide estimates of liver function in support of the liver elastography component.

Eligible Sample
Examined participants aged 12 years and older were eligible.

Description of Laboratory Methodology
All methods were measured on the Roche Cobas 6000 (c501 module) analyzer.

Iron (Frozen)

The Roche method of iron measurement is a three-step process using FerroZine reagent: Fe3+ is liberated from transferrin by acid/detergent, Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by ascorbate, and the reduced iron then reacts with the FerroZine reagent to form a colored complex. The intensity of this final product is directly proportional to the iron concentration in the sample.

Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC)

In the first step of the measurement process in the Roche method for UIBC, excess Fe2+ is added to the specimen. In an alkaline environment it is converted to Fe3+ as it binds to the unbound endogenous transferrin. The unbound Fe2+ in the reagent then reacts with FerroZine reagent to form a colored compound. This is an inverse outcome: greater color development indicates the transferrin is more highly occupied by iron (low UIBC). Lesser color development indicates that the transferrin has more binding capacity available (high UIBC). Because of this characteristic and the calibration model, all results are multiplied by a factor (-1) to yield a positive result. This is a two-point, endpoint reaction, with measurement occurring at 546 nm (secondary wavelength 700 nm).

Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)

Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) was calculated indirectly using Iron (frozen), serum and Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity, serum (UIBC):

Calculated TIBC (LBDTIB) = [Iron (frozen), serum (LBXIRN) + UIBC, serum (LBXUIB)]

Transferrin Saturation (%Sat)

Transferrin saturation (%Sat) value was calculated using Iron (frozen), serum and calculated Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC):

Calculated %Sat (LBDPCT) = [Iron (frozen), serum (LBXIRN) / TIBC (LBDTIB)] x 100
